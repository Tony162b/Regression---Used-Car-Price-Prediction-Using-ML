# Regression---Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Using-ML

Objective
Come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and help the business devise profitable strategies using differential pricing.
There are two main goals I want to achieve to resolve this problem.
The first is to estimate the price of used cars by considering all the features based on historical data. 
Second, to better understand the most relevant features that help determine the price of a used car.
Regressors used for this project are Linear Regression, Lasso/Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
